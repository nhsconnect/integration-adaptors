  title: NHAIS Adaptor (FHIR) API
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to access the NHAIS Adaptor API

    You can:
    * Accept a new patient
    * Amend an existing patient's demographics
    * Request a Removal for a patient who has moved out of area
    * Request a Deduction for a supported reason

    The NHAIS Adaptor does not store any patient demograpic data and no GET operations are supported.

    The API is based on the [Personal Demographics Service API](https://github.com/NHSDigital/personal-demographics-service-api)

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/introduction-to-apis#basic-rest).

    It also conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/introduction-to-apis#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange.
    Specifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), which is built on FHIR Release 4.

    You don’t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example the `/Patient` not `/patients`
    - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    ## Endpoints
    To see details for specific endpoints, select from the list on the left hand side of the page:
    * `GET /Patient` - search for patient
    * `GET /Patient/{id}` - get patient's personal details
    * `PATCH /Patient/{id}` - update patient's personal details

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to send a Deduction transaction to NHAIS.

        ## Operation Id
        When you submit an amendment an operation id will be included in the response. This operation id MUST be retained
        to match against the asynchronous reply from NHAIS

        ## EDIFACT

        The following Interchange contains just one Deduction Request transaction for:

        NHS Number N/10/10.
        Deduction Date : 25/12/1991, Deduction Reason : Death, Free Text : Died on holiday in Majorca.
        Registered with GP 281 (GMC National GP Code 4826940).

        Information transmitted within Interchange 2, Message 3, Transaction Number 17 at 13:17 on 13/01/1992.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to send an Amendment to NHAIS.

        This is a 'patch' operation, meaning you can update specific parts of the patient record (such as a name or an address), as opposed to having to update the entire record.

        ## Operation Id
        When you submit an amendment an operation id will be included in the response. This operation id MUST be retained
        to match against the asynchronous reply from NHAIS
