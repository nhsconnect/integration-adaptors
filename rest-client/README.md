### Environment Variables 

Environment variables are store in `settings.json` file located in `.vscode` folder. An example of how to set up file:

```http
{
    "python.pythonPath": "/usr/local/bin/python3",
    "workbench.settings.editor": "json",
    "workbench.settings.useSplitJSON": true,
    "rest-client.environmentVariables": {
        "$shared": {},
        "$sample_mhs_environment": {
            "BASE_URL": "http://localhost",
                        "INBOUND-PORT": "8082",
                        "OUTBOUND-PORT": "80",
                        "ROUTE-LOOKUP-PORT": "8088",
                        "FAKE-SPINE-PORT": "8091",
                        "ASID": "9XXXXXXXXXXX",
                        "PARTY-KEY": "A9XXXX-XXXXXXX",
                        "REF-TO-MESSAGE-ID": "8936cd14-d728-41a7-8d14-485183ebc2de"
        }
    }
}
```

When in selected http file, ensure at the bottom right corner the environment you wish to use is selected. As default this is set to `no environment`. In this repo a `sample-mhs-environment` has been created in the settings file, to be used as sample content. It will be listed in the environment list. `$shared` variables will be available when no environment is selected. 

Enironment variables can be used in a http file by surrounding text with curly braces and the name of variable inside `{{GUID}}`.

### File Variables

File variable are available to the file its declared in, example of format below:

```http
@baseUrl = https://example.com
```

Can be used in file as shown below in the Request Line:

```http
POST {{baseUrl}}:80 HTTP/1.1
```

<br>

### Generate UUID

Currently it is only possible to generate UUID manual using an extension. To generator new UUID, `fn` + `F1` and type `Insert GUID` where needed. Currently an environment variable is used in settings.json for this to be easily changed in all http files.
