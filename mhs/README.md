# MHS

This package contains a pre-assured implementation of a Message Handling Service (MHS), intended to encapsulate the
details of Spine messaging and provide a simple interface to allow HL7 messages to be sent to a remote MHS.

## Setup
A `data/certs` directory should be created with the following files (containing the certificates & keys required to
perform client authentication to the Spine instance you are using. For Openttest, these will have been provided when you
were granted access):
- `client.cert` - Should include the following in this order: endpoint certificate, endpoint issuing subCA certificate,
root CA Certificate.
- `client.key` - Your endpoint private key
- `client.pem` - A copy of client.cert
- `party_key.txt` - The party key associated with your MHS build

If you are using Opentest, each of these credentials will have been provided when you were granted access.

Finally, ensure you have [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/) installed and on your path, then from this
directory run:
```
pipenv install
```

### Developer Setup
To prepare a development environment for this application, ensure you have [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/)
installed and on your path, then from this directory run:
```
pipenv install --dev
```

### Running Unit Tests
- `pipenv run unittests` will run all unit tests.
- `pipenv run unittests-cov` will run all unit tests, generating a [Coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) report
in the `test-reports` directory.
- `pipenv run coverage-report` will print the coverage report generated by `unittests-cov`
- `pipenv run coverage-report-xml` will produce an XML version of the coverage report generated by `unittests-cov`, in a
[Cobertura](http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/) compatible format
- `pipenv run coverage-report-html` will produce an HTML version of the coverage report generated by `unittests-cov`

## Coverage
`pipenv run unittests-cov` will run all unit tests with coverage enabled. \
`pipenv run coverage-report-xml` will generate an xml file which can then be submitted for coverage analysis.

## Analysis
To use sonarqube analysis you will need to have installed `sonar-scanner`. \
Ensure sonar-scanner is on your path, and configured for the sonarqube host with appropriate token.
 (See: [SonarQube](https://gpitbjss.atlassian.net/wiki/x/XQFfXQ))\
`sonar-scanner` will use `sonar-project.properties` to submit source to sonarqube for analysis. \
NOTE: Coverage will not show in the analysis unless you have already generated the xml report (as per above.)

## Running Integration Tests
`pipenv run inttests` will run all integration tests.

When running the tests locally, you will need to set the MHS_ADDRESS and ASID in the 'Environment variables' section of
 the Run/Debug Configurations.
- The ASID is a 12 digit number needed to access Opentest, supplied by NHS Digital
    - eg ASID=123456789012
- The MHS_ADDRESS is the hostname of the MHS instance being used for testing and should be supplied in it's raw state,
 without the 'http://' prefix or '/' suffix
    - eg MHS_ADDRESS=localhost will be resolved as 'http://localhost/'



Any content POSTed to `/` on port 80 will result in the request configuration for the `path` entry in
`data/interactions.json` being loaded and the content sent as the body of the request to Spine. Adding entries to
`interactions.json` will allow you to define new supported interactions.
