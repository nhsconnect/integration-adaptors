# MHS

This package contains a pre-assured implementation of a Message Handling Service (MHS), intended to encapsulate the
details of Spine messaging and provide a simple interface to allow HL7 messages to be sent to a remote MHS.

## Setup
A `data/certs` directory should be created with the following files (containing the certificates & keys required to
perform client authentication to the Spine instance you are using. For Openttest, these will have been provided when you
were granted access):
- `client.cert` - Should include the following in this order: endpoint certificate, endpoint issuing subCA certificate,
root CA Certificate.
- `client.key` - Your endpoint private key
- `client.pem` - A copy of client.cert
- `party_key.txt` - The party key associated with your MHS build

The certs path and each files name should also be refrenced in the main method of mhs/outbound/main.py.

If you are using Opentest, each of these credentials will have been provided when you were granted access.

Finally, ensure you have [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/) installed and on your path, then from this
directory run:
```
pipenv install
```

### Developer Setup
To prepare a development environment for this application, ensure you have [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/)
installed and on your path, then within each of the subfolders `common`, `inbound` and `outbound` in this directory, run:
```
pipenv install --dev
```

## Running MHS
MHS is made up of multiple components, and running them all separately can be tedious. Instead, use Docker Compose, see [here](../README.md) for how to do this.

### Environment Variables
MHS takes a number of environment variables when it is run. These are:
* `MHS_LOG_LEVEL` This is required to be set to one of: `NOTSET`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` or `CRITICAL`. Where `NOTSET` displays the most logs and `CRITICAL` displays the least.
* `MHS_STATE_TABLE_NAME` The name of the DynamoDB table used to store MHS state.
* `MHS_OUTBOUND_TRANSMISSION_MAX_RETRIES` (outbound only) This is the maximum number of retries for outbound requests. If no value is given a default of 3 is used.
* `MHS_OUTBOUND_TRANSMISSION_RETRY_DELAY` (outbound only) The delay between retries of outbound requests in milliseconds. If no value is given, a default of `100` is used.
* `MHS_INBOUND_QUEUE_HOST` (inbound only) The host url of the amqp inbound queue. e.g. `amqps://example.com:port/queue-name`. Note that if the amqp connection being used is a secured connection (which it should be in production), then the url should start with `amqps://` and not `amqp+ssl://`.
* `MHS_INBOUND_QUEUE_USERNAME` (inbound only) The username to use when connecting to the amqp inbound queue.
* `MHS_INBOUND_QUEUE_PASSWORD` (inbound only) The password to use when connecting to the amqp inbound queue.
* `MHS_INBOUND_QUEUE_MAX_RETRIES` (inbound only) The max number of times to retry putting a message onto the amqp inbound queue. Defaults to 3.
* `MHS_INBOUND_QUEUE_RETRY_DELAY` (inbound only) The delay in milliseconds between retrying putting a message onto the amqp inbound queue. Defaults to 100ms.
* `SYNC_ASYNC_STORE_MAX_RETRIES'` (inbound only) The max number of retries when attempting to add a message to the sync-async store. Defaults to 3 
* `SYNC_ASYNC_STORE_RETRY_DELAY` (inbound only) The delay in milliseconds between retrying placing a message on the sysnc-async store. Defaults to 100ms

## Running Unit Tests
- `pipenv run unittests` will run all unit tests.
- `pipenv run unittests-cov` will run all unit tests, generating a [Coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) report
in the `test-reports` directory.
- `pipenv run coverage-report` will print the coverage report generated by `unittests-cov`
- `pipenv run coverage-report-xml` will produce an XML version of the coverage report generated by `unittests-cov`, in a
[Cobertura](http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/) compatible format
- `pipenv run coverage-report-html` will produce an HTML version of the coverage report generated by `unittests-cov`

## Coverage
`pipenv run unittests-cov` will run all unit tests with coverage enabled. \
`pipenv run coverage-report-xml` will generate an xml file which can then be submitted for coverage analysis.

## Analysis
To use sonarqube analysis you will need to have installed `sonar-scanner`. \
Ensure sonar-scanner is on your path, and configured for the sonarqube host with appropriate token.
 (See: [SonarQube](https://gpitbjss.atlassian.net/wiki/x/XQFfXQ))\
`sonar-scanner` will use `sonar-project.properties` to submit source to sonarqube for analysis. \
NOTE: Coverage will not show in the analysis unless you have already generated the xml report (as per above.)

## Running Integration Tests
The integration tests are in ../integration-tests. Refer to the README file in this directory



Any content POSTed to `/` on port 80 will result in the request configuration for the `path` entry in
`data/interactions.json` being loaded and the content sent as the body of the request to Spine. Adding entries to
`interactions.json` will allow you to define new supported interactions.
