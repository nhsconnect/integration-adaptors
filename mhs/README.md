# MHS

This package contains a pre-assured implementation of a Message Handling Service (MHS), intended to encapsulate the
details of Spine messaging and provide a simple interface to allow HL7 messages to be sent to a remote MHS.

**WARNING: Verification of the server certificate received when making a connection to a remote MHS is currently
DISABLED (see the [OutboundTransmission](./outbound/outbound/transmission/outbound_transmission.py) class'
`make_request` method).** This MHS should not be used in a production environment unless this certificate verification
is re-enabled.

## Setup
You'll need to have a connection to Spine. For testing purposes, you can use [Opentest](https://nhs-digital-opentest.github.io/Welcome/index.html).

Finally, ensure you have [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/) installed and on your path, then within each of
the subfolders `common`, `inbound` and `outbound` in this directory, run:
```
pipenv install
```

### Developer Setup
To prepare a development environment for this application, ensure you have [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/)
installed and on your path, then within each of the subfolders `common`, `inbound` and `outbound` in this directory, run:
```
pipenv install --dev
```

If the build fails due to dependency issues with proton, follow these instructions:
1) Visit: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
2) Download the 'Community Edition'
3) Run the installer once the download has completed
4) Select the **Desktop development with C++** workload option
5) Once the installation has completed you may have to reboot.


## Running MHS
MHS is made up of multiple components, and running them all separately can be tedious. Instead, use Docker Compose, see [here](../README.md) for how to do this.

## API docs
MHS outbound (which is the API that suppliers use to make requests to the MHS) is documented using
[OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.2). These docs can be generated by running `pipenv run generate-openapi-docs` in
the `mhs/outbound` folder. The output of this command can be saved to a file, then transformed into another format (eg client
SDK, HTML docs) using various OpenAPI tools available online. For example:

```bash
pipenv run generate-openapi-docs > test.json
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/local  openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -g html -i /local/test.json -o /local/out/html
```

generates HTML docs. An invocation of this command can be seen
[here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nhsconnect/integration-adaptors/blob/develop/mhs/outbound/openapi-docs.html).

### Environment Variables
MHS takes a number of environment variables when it is run. These are:
* `MHS_LOG_LEVEL` This is required to be set to one of: `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` or `CRITICAL`, where `INFO` displays
the most logs and `CRITICAL` displays the least. Note: Setting this value to one of the more detailed 'standard' Python
log levels (such as `DEBUG` or `NOTSET`) may result in the libraries used by this application logging details that
contain sensitive information such as the content of messages being sent.
* `MHS_SECRET_PARTY_KEY` (inbound & outbound only) The party key associated with your MHS.
* `MHS_SECRET_CLIENT_CERT` Your endpoint certificate
* `MHS_SECRET_CLIENT_KEY` Your endpoint private key
* `MHS_SECRET_CA_CERTS` Should include the following in this order: endpoint issuing subCA certificate, root CA Certificate.

* `MHS_SDS_SEARCH_BASE` (Spine Route Lookup service only) The LDAP location to use as the base of SDS searches, e.g. `ou=services,o=nhs`. This value is specific to the SDS instance you configure your MHS to communicate with and should not contain whitespace.
* `MHS_DISABLE_SDS_TLS` (Spine Route Lookup service only) An optional flag that can be set to disable TLS for SDS
connections. *Must* be set to exactly `True` for TLS to be disabled.
* `MHS_SDS_CACHE_EXPIRY_TIME` (Spine Route Lookup service only). An optional value that specifies the time (in seconds)

    store after the outbound service receives an acknowledgement from Spine
* `MHS_SPINE_REQUEST_MAX_SIZE` (outbound service only) The maximum size (in bytes) that request bodies sent to Spine
are allowed to be. This should be set minus any HTTP headers and other content in the HTTP packets sent to Spine.
e.g. Setting this to ~400 bytes less than the maximum request body size should be roughly the correct value
(calculating this value accurately is pretty much impossible as one of the HTTP headers is the Content-Length header
which varies depending on the request body size).

Note that if you are using Opentest, you should use the credentials you were given when you got access to set `MHS_SECRET_PARTY_KEY`, `MHS_SECRET_CLIENT_CERT`, `MHS_SECRET_CLIENT_KEY` and `MHS_SECRET_CA_CERTS`.

## Running Unit Tests
- `pipenv run unittests` will run all unit tests.
- `pipenv run unittests-cov` will run all unit tests, generating a [Coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) report
in the `test-reports` directory.
- `pipenv run coverage-report` will print the coverage report generated by `unittests-cov`
- `pipenv run coverage-report-xml` will produce an XML version of the coverage report generated by `unittests-cov`, in a
[Cobertura](http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/) compatible format
- `pipenv run coverage-report-html` will produce an HTML version of the coverage report generated by `unittests-cov`

## Coverage
`pipenv run unittests-cov` will run all unit tests with coverage enabled. \
`pipenv run coverage-report-xml` will generate an xml file which can then be submitted for coverage analysis.

## Analysis
To use sonarqube analysis you will need to have installed `sonar-scanner`. \
Ensure sonar-scanner is on your path, and configured for the sonarqube host with appropriate token.
 (See: [SonarQube](https://gpitbjss.atlassian.net/wiki/x/XQFfXQ))\
`sonar-scanner` will use `sonar-project.properties` to submit source to sonarqube for analysis. \
NOTE: Coverage will not show in the analysis unless you have already generated the xml report (as per above.)

## Running Integration Tests
See the [integration tests README](../integration-tests/README.md).

Timeouts received whilst waiting for a response from Spine on a Windows machine could be due to the machine rejecting incoming connections on port 443. In order to open the port, follow these instructions:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/create-an-inbound-port-rule

Any content POSTed to `/` on port 80 will result in the request configuration for the `Interaction-Id` header in
`data/interactions.json` being loaded and the content sent as the body of the request to Spine. Adding entries to
`interactions.json` will allow you to define new supported interactions.
