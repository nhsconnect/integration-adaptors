# Pipeline

This directory contains resources related to the CI/CD pipeline used to build the artifacts contained within this repository.

These resources consist of the following directories:
- `packer` - [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) templates used to build container images used as part of the pipeline
- `scripts`- Custom scripts that are used as part of the pipeline
- `terraform` - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configurations used to deploy the test environments used as part
of the pipeline

The pipeline itself is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` in the root of the repository.

# Pre-Requisites

In order to run the build pipeline, the following resources must be created manually:

- An S3 bucket to be used to store the Terraform state databases for the MHS & SCR configurations. This allows deployed resources to be re-used in
subsequent builds, reducing the time needed to deploy updated services.
    - It is recommended that default encryption of objects in this bucket is enabled when creating it
- Two DynamoDB tables to be used to allow Terraform to lock the shared state of the MHS & SCR configurations, preventing issues if concurrent deployments
of the same environment are performed. These tables must have a primary key named `LockID`.
- Log groups in Cloudwatch under the following names:
    - `/ecs/jenkins-master`
    - `/ecs/jenkins-workers-jenkins-worker`
    - `/ecs/scr-service-environment`
    - `/ecs/sonarqube`
- ECR repositories with the following names:
    - `mhs/inbound`
    - `mhs/outbound`
    - `mhs/route`
    - `scr-web-service`
- An IAM role to allow the ECS service to execute ECS tasks. This must be a service role (see the
[AWS documentation on creating roles for AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html))
with the trusted entity set to 'Elastic Container Service Task' with the built-in `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy`.
You can use the `ecsTaskExecutionRole` created for you automatically by AWS when creating a task definition from the
console, if available.
  - This role also needs a policy to allow it to fetch the required secrets from AWS secrets manager (see below for
  details of the required secrets). This policy should look like:
```
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
            "Resource": [
                "list of secret ARNs here"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
- An IAM role to allow the ECS service to auto-scale ECS tasks. This must be a service role (see the
[AWS documentation on creating roles for AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html))
with the trusted entity set to 'Elastic Container Service Autoscale' which has the AWS managed
'AmazonEC2ContainerServiceAutoscaleRole' policy assigned to it. This can be created by following the AWS documentation
on the [Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling IAM Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/autoscale_IAM_role.html)
- An IAM role for the MHS containers to use to run as (the `TASK_ROLE` mentioned [below](#global-variables)).
This must be a service role (see the
[AWS documentation on creating roles for AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html))
with the trusted entity set to 'Elastic Container Service Task' and have the policy:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchWriteItem",
                "dynamodb:ConditionCheckItem",
                "dynamodb:PutItem",
                "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:Scan",
                "dynamodb:Query",
                "dynamodb:UpdateItem"
            ],
            "ARNs of DynamoDB tables to allow access to"
        }
    ]
}
```
- An IAM role for the ECS task (i.e Jenkins worker) running the build pipeline. This must be a service role (see the
[AWS documentation on creating roles for AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html))
with the trusted entity set to 'Elastic Container Service Task' which includes the following AWS managed IAM policies, in order to allow the built
containers to be published to ECR and the integration test environment to be stood up by Terraform:
    - AmazonS3FullAccess
    - AmazonVPCFullAccess
    - ElasticLoadBalancingFullAccess
    - AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser
    - AmazonECS_FullAccess
    - AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess
    - CloudWatchLogsFullAccess
    - AmazonRoute53FullAccess
    - AmazonElastiCacheFullAccess
- An ECS Cluster for the SCR application to be deployed into. This must be an EC2 Linux cluster.
- Two TLS certificates. One to be used for the outbound load balancer and one for the route load balancer
    - These certificates should be stored in AWS Certificate Manager (they can either be requested through Certificate
    Manager, or imported into it)
    - If you wish to use self-signed certificates, these can be generated using OpenSSL with the following command:
    `openssl req -x509 -subj //CN=<lb-hostname> -newkey rsa:<key-length> -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days <days-until-expiry>`
        - Where route-lb-hostname is the DNS name of the loadbalancer. This is
        `mhs-outbound.<environment-id>.<internal_root_domain>` for the outbound loadbalancer and
        `mhs-route.<environment-id>.<internal_root_domain>` for the route loadbalancer, where `environment-id` and
        `<internal_root_domain>` are the variables provided to Terraform when deploying the exmplar blueprint.
        - Where key-length is the length of the RSA key (in bits) to use for the certificate
        - Where days-until-expiry is the number of days the generated certificate should be valid for
        - e.g: `openssl req -x509 -subj //CN=mhs-outbound.example-environment.myteam.example.com -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365`
- Entries in AWS Secrets Manager for all sensitive data. These entries should be created by following the [AWS tutorial
on storing secrets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/tutorials_basic.html#tutorial-basic-step1),
selecting to store the secret as "Other type of secrets" and entering the required value using the plaintext tab (these
values should not be specified as JSON). The following secrets are required:
    - The username to use when connecting to the AMQP inbound queue
    - The password to use when connecting to the AMQP inbound queue
    - The party key associated with your MHS
    - The client certificate the outbound MHS component should present to other MHS instances
    - The private key for the client certificate the outbound MHS component should present to other MHS instances
    - (Optional) The CA certificates used to validate the certificates presented by the MHS. This value is required if
    the certificate you have used for the outbound load balancer (above) is not signed by a legitimate CA. If you have
    used a self-signed certificate, this value can be that certificate.
    - (Optional) The CA certificates used to validate the certificate presented by the MHS' route service. This value is required if
    the certificate you have used for the route load balancer (above) is not signed by a legitimate CA. If you have
    used a self-signed certificate, this value can be that certificate.

# Jenkins

We are running a Jenkins master instance as an ECS Docker container. This is configured to, via the [amazon-ecs plugin], spin up Jenkins worker ECS Docker containers to run the pipeline.

In order to achieve this, a number of components are required:
- there are some subfolders in the `packer` folder with files for creating the Docker images for the Jenkins master and workers.
- when configuring the [amazon-ecs plugin], some credentials need to be provided that can be used to create/destroy the Jenkins workers. This can be done by creating an IAM role following the information [here][amazon-ecs plugin] in the _IAM role_ section. The IAM role should have the trust policy:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```
I found I also needed to add a permission policy that looked like:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::<account id>:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole"
        }
    ]
}
```
where `ecsTaskExecutionRole` is a default role created when creating task definitions.
- The Jenkins worker EC2 instance must have an IAM role assigned, as described in [the pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)
section above.
